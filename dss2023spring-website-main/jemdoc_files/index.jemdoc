=== Class info

*Time*: Monday 7:20-9:45PM

*Location*: C1-207

This 8-week seminar course is geared towards first or second-year graduate students who are interested in the fundamental aspects and the state-of-art developments of  machine learning techniques. 
In this semester, we will cover a number of  representation learning topics, including structured prediction, non-linear dimension reduction, metric learning and deep representations for structured data. 

*Prerequisites*: Students who have taken a graduate-level introductory machine learning class (e.g. Learning from Data or its equivalent) and received a final grade of B or above.   Sufficient background in math, probability and optimization  for understanding research papers  is also expected.

For more information about the class policies, see the [./media/syllabus.pdf class syllabus].
